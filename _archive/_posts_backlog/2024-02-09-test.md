Continuing on from my previous post on emerging tech's value in healthcare, I was intrigued to review EHR adoption across other countries.  As I wrote about in a previous [post](https://slsu0424.github.io/switchover-disruptions-true-cost-ai-scribe), EHRs still have a lot left to be desired by its users, despite the fact that [96% of hospitals](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/96-of-us-hospitals-have-ehrs-but-barriers-remain-to-interoperability-onc-says.html) now have EHRs.  Of course, I'm just about as excited as everyone else at generative AI's potential to reduce this administrative workload for clinical staff.  But is this emerging tech significant enough to make a meaningful impact?

## EHR use in the US vs. abroad: Key findings

A 2020 JAMA [report](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774129) set out to compare clinician usage of EHRs in the United States and in other countries.   
For this piece, I will focus on the paper's results and discussion, and its implications from a technology perspective.

Key findings:
- In this cross-sectional study of the EHR metadata of 371 health systems in the US and abroad, US clinicians vs non-US clinicians were found to spend more time per day actively using the EHR, receive more system-generated messages, write a higher proportion of automatically generated note text, and spend more time using the EHR after hours.

## Considerations for the technologist

## Conclusion

This short analysis helped me better understand the external forces driving the ever-increasing costs of healthcare in the United States.  Despite the technological prowess of the US, our country still falls behind in terms of health outcomes and spend.  I suspect that if we continue to see more consolidations, these tech innovations could play a more important role in health outcomes.  

I am also interested in looking at similar tech adoption in other developed countries, and will cover this in a future post.
