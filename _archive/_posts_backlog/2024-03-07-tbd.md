"Healthcare loves a new new thing and generative AI is now it", stated Robert Galvin, MD, an executive advisor of The Blackstone Group in this Forbes [piece](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sachinjain/2023/12/14/2024-healthcare-insiders-predict-the-future) predicting the top 2024 healthcare trends.  In following the latest announcements from VIVE to HIMSS, it was refreshing to see emerging technologies take center stage to great fanfare.  However, as much as new technology is revolutionary, healthcare has always been a laggard.  Today is no different.  Yet, in this unique time of technological progress, I think most people (including myself) would argue that healthcare should become revolutionary.  The bigger question that still looms is: *Could* healthcare become revolutionary?

## Generative AI is having its moment in the clinic
AI is nothing new, and I've noted in recent conversations that this wave seems reminiscent of IBM Watson's heyday.  Has anything changed since then?  To a degree, I would say yes.  This moment in AI is the "perfect storm".  Hospitals are struggling to rebound financially after the pandemic, healthcare data is plentiful, and computing has become more powerful, cheap, and smart.  As noted by the authors in HBR's [Why the Tech Industry Won’t Disrupt Health Care](https://hbr.org/2024/02/why-the-tech-industry-wont-disrupt-health-care), healthcare organizations must transform themselves to stay relevant.  Failure to reduce costs, improve quality, and expand access, will render them obsolete.

At a time where clinicians are facing more burnout due to regulatory requirements, an aging population, and hospitals margins are running thin, I believe technology could play a bigger role here.


## Revolution vs. evolution
But could healthcare be disrupted in the same ways that Big Tech has done with other industries?  

Dr. Galvin goes on to say that "CHAT GPT 4 and other large learning and generative models are truly revolutionary, but change in clinical medical is always evolutionary".  In a previous [interviews](https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.19.0619) with Dr. David Blumenthal and Dr. Namita Seth Mohta in 2019, they went on to highlight some of the challenges with new tech in healthcare:

> "Galvin:  Sometimes the unintended consequences exceed the benefits, to be honest. When you get into a system as big as health care, as resistant to change in health care, and inherently much more complicated, this is not buying goods and services over Amazon; this is not getting an Uber or using Lyft. These are in many cases very sick people with complicated diseases in a system that’s already very complicated.

> Blumenthal:  The 5% of patients who account for 50% of expenditures need continuous longitudinal care, comprehensive care, and care that’s knowledgeable about their complicated problems. Their simple problems are often complicated by their other conditions. So it’s hard to imagine solving our major health care issues, especially around cost, without developing effective systems for caring for that 5%. That’s where the money is, and it’s also where many of our quality and safety problems are, because those are the patients who are in constant contact with our health care system."

Granted, this conversation was before the pandemic, but the concepts still remain the same.  What does it means for technology to be revolutionary vs. evolutionary?  In an article written by
