"Healthcare loves a new new thing and generative AI is now it", stated Robert Galvin, MD, an executive advisor of The Blackstone Group, in this Forbes [piece](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sachinjain/2023/12/14/2024-healthcare-insiders-predict-the-future) predicting the top 2024 healthcare trends.  In following the latest announcements from VIVE to HIMSS, it was refreshing to see emerging technologies take center stage to great fanfare.  However, as much as new technology is revolutionary, healthcare has always been a laggard.  Yet, in this unique time of technological progress, most people (including myself) would argue that healthcare should become revolutionary.  But *could* healthcare become revolutionary?

## Generative AI is having its moment in the clinic
AI is nothing new, and I've noted in recent conversations that this wave seems reminiscent of IBM Watson's heyday.  Has anything changed since then?  To a degree, I would say yes.  One could consider this moment in AI as the "perfect storm", as hospitals look to regain profitability post-pandemic and computing has become more powerful, cheap, and smart.  
As highlighted in Harvard Business Review's [Why the Tech Industry Won’t Disrupt Health Care](https://hbr.org/2024/02/why-the-tech-industry-wont-disrupt-health-care), healthcare organizations must transform themselves to stay relevant.  Failure to reduce costs, improve quality, and expand access will render them obsolete.

Technology transformation is nothing new for healthcare.  As the HBR authors note, providers have transformed consistently but slowly, including reimbursement changes, EHR adoption, and increased focus on [whole person health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/whole-person-health-what-you-need-to-know).  I would hardly call any of these changes revolutionary though, unlike Big Tech which has completely revolutionized other industries.  The HBR authors argue that this is by design, and any new entrants will find it difficult to uproot existing healthcare dynamics.

Of course, generative AI capabilities are truly impressive.  While the machine learning models underpinning generative AI have [been around](https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-generative-ai-1109) for decades, its popularity has soared due to the complexity of tasks (images, audio, etc.) that can be performed and the amount of data (scale) on which these tasks are trained.  For text generation (ChatGPT), the underlying [transformer architecture](https://learnopencv.com/attention-mechanism-in-transformer-neural-networks/ and https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) has allowed AI systems to generate new text with remarkable accuracy over its predecessors.  This technology is being seen as a huge boon in the clinic, with use cases ranging from patient case summarization to drafting responses to patient messages.

## Revolutionary vs. evolutionary technology
But could healthcare eventually be disrupted in the same ways that Big Tech has done with other industries?

Dr. Galvin goes on to say that "CHAT GPT 4 and other large learning and generative models are truly revolutionary, but change in clinical medical is always evolutionary".  In a previous [interview](https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.19.0619) with Dr. David Blumenthal and Dr. Namita Seth Mohta in 2019, they went on to highlight some of the challenges with new tech in healthcare:

> "Galvin:  Sometimes the unintended consequences exceed the benefits, to be honest. When you get into a system as big as health care, as resistant to change in health care, and inherently much more complicated, this is not buying goods and services over Amazon; this is not getting an Uber or using Lyft. These are in many cases very sick people with complicated diseases in a system that’s already very complicated.

> Blumenthal:  The 5% of patients who account for 50% of expenditures need continuous longitudinal care, comprehensive care, and care that’s knowledgeable about their complicated problems. Their simple problems are often complicated by their other conditions. So it’s hard to imagine solving our major health care issues, especially around cost, without developing effective systems for caring for that 5%. That’s where the money is, and it’s also where many of our quality and safety problems are, because those are the patients who are in constant contact with our health care system."

This made make me think a bit about what it would take for a technology to become a revolutionary vs. evolutionary.  In another HBR [article](https://hbr.org/2011/06/would-you-rather-be-revolution), author Jeffrey Stibel writes about the automobile as a revolutionary innovation, while building better engines for car as an evolutionary innovation.  He goes on to differentiate between the two: Revolutionary innovations are completely novel; evolutionary innovations build on existing solutions and limitations.

One of the challenges I see with revolutionary technology in healthcare is that it may not significantly impact the 5% that Dr. Blumenthal mentions.  If we're interested in reducing costs, I think generative AI will face limitations and fall into the evolutionary category.  In contrast, the 95% of patients who have everyday health concerns will likely be revolutionized by generative AI.  However, it may not move the needle very far when it comes to cost.    

## Moving healthcare beyond evolutionary technology
As Dr. Blumenthal notes, there needs to be effective systems (beyond technology) to care for the 5%.  If we want healthcare to transform as an industry, it is imperative to involve all stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem.  Although there have been well-known [partnerships](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-selects-google-as-strategic-partner-for-health-care-innovation-cloud-computing) between technology companies and health system, new collaborations have sprung up among a diverse set of players.  These include health systems, payers, technology companies, government entities, and patients.  Recent collaborations include the [Coalition for Health AI (CHAI)](https://www.coalitionforhealthai.org), [Trustworthy & Responsible AI Network (TRAIN)](https://news.microsoft.com/2024/03/11/new-consortium-of-healthcare-leaders-announces-formation-of-trustworthy-responsible-ai-network-train-making-safe-and-fair-ai-accessible-to-every-healthcare-organization), and [VALID AI](https://validai.health), among others.  It will be interesting to see how these collaborations shape up to address healthcare challenges with AI.

## Conclusion
Its clear that AI in healthcare has been making significant headway in the last year, but it remains debatable if it can truly revolutionize the industry.  It was interesting to consider revolutionary technologies such as generative AI, in the context of the healthcare industry, which has managed well thus far with evolutionary technologies.  It will be interesting to see if these new collaborations will effectively change healthcare.
