"Healthcare loves a new new thing and generative AI is now it", stated Robert Galvin, MD, an executive advisor of The Blackstone Group in this Forbes [piece](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sachinjain/2023/12/14/2024-healthcare-insiders-predict-the-future) predicting the top 2024 healthcare trends.  In following the recent announcements from VIVE to HIMSS, it was refreshing to see emerging technologies take center stage to great fanfare.  However, as much as new technology is revolutionary, healthcare has opposed it hand over fist.  The nature of our healthcare system is slow to change.  In this unique time of technological progress, I think most people (including myself) would argue that healthcare should become revolutionary.  But the bigger question is: *Could* healthcare become revolutionary?

## Generative AI is having its moment in the clinic
AI is nothing new, but I would say this moment in AI is the "perfect storm".  Hospitals are struggling to rebound after the pandemic, healthcare data is plentiful, and computing has become more powerful and 'smart'.  The time is now to harness healthcare data for insights.  As noted by the authors in HBR's [Why the Tech Industry Won’t Disrupt Health Care](https://hbr.org/2024/02/why-the-tech-industry-wont-disrupt-health-care), healthcare organizations must transform themselves to stay relevant.  Failure to reduce costs, improve quality, and expand access, will render them obsolete.

Indeed, it is concerning that clinicians are facing more burnout, and hospitals are merging to stay financially viable.  


## Revolution vs. evolution
But could healthcare be disrupted?  Is it up to tech to lead it?  Let's consider this from the perspective of technology, which is often thought of as revolutionary.  What makes something revolutionary vs. evolutionary?  Dr. Galvin goes on to say that "CHAT GPT 4 and other large learning and generative models are truly revolutionary, but change in clinical medical is always evolutionary".  In one of his talks with Dr. David Blumenthal and Dr. Namita Seth Mohta in 2019, they went on to highlight some of the challenges with new tech in healthcare:

"Galvin:  Sometimes the unintended consequences exceed the benefits, to be honest. When you get into a system as big as health care, as resistant to change in health care, and inherently much more complicated, this is not buying goods and services over Amazon; this is not getting an Uber or using Lyft. These are in many cases very sick people with complicated diseases in a system that’s already very complicated.

The misinformation is another unintended consequence; I’m not sure how good Alexa is going to be, or whether there’s going to be any clinical judgment in Alexa. If you go onto the Web and look for health care information, it’s as likely to be inaccurate as it is to be accurate."


This got me thinking a bit about what it means for technology to be revolutionary vs. evolutionary.

CHAT GPT 4 and other large learning and generative models are truly revolutionary, but change in clinical medical is always evolutionary
