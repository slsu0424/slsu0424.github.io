"Healthcare loves a new new thing and generative AI is now it", stated Robert Galvin, MD, an executive advisor of The Blackstone Group in this Forbes [piece](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sachinjain/2023/12/14/2024-healthcare-insiders-predict-the-future) predicting the top 2024 healthcare trends.  In following the latest announcements from VIVE to HIMSS, it was refreshing to see emerging technologies take center stage to great fanfare.  However, as much as new technology is revolutionary, healthcare has always been a laggard.  Today is no different.  Yet, in this unique time of technological progress, I think most people (including myself) would argue that healthcare should become revolutionary.  The bigger question that still looms is: *Could* healthcare become revolutionary?


## Generative AI is having its moment in the clinic
AI is nothing new, and I've noted in recent conversations that this wave seems reminiscent of IBM Watson's heyday.  Has anything changed since then?  To a degree, I would say yes.  One could consider this moment in AI as the "perfect storm", as hospitals look to regain profitability post-pandemic and computing has become more powerful, cheap, and smart.  
As noted in this recent Harvard Business Review piece [Why the Tech Industry Won’t Disrupt Health Care](https://hbr.org/2024/02/why-the-tech-industry-wont-disrupt-health-care), healthcare organizations must transform themselves to stay relevant.  Failure to reduce costs, improve quality, and expand access will render them obsolete.

But technology transformation is nothing new for healthcare.  As the HBR authors note, providers have transformed consistently but slowly, including reimbursement changes, EHR adoption, and increased focus on [whole person health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/whole-person-health-what-you-need-to-know).  

I would hardly call any of these changes revolutionary though, unlike Big Tech which has completely revolutionized other industries.  The HBR authors argue that this is by design, and any new entrants will find it difficult to uproot existing healthcare dynamics.

Of course, generative AI capabilities are truly impressive.  While the machine learning models underpinning generative AI have [been around](https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-generative-ai-1109) for decades, its popularity has soared due to the complexity of tasks (images, audio, etc.) that can be performed and the amount of data (scale) on which these tasks are trained.  For text generation (ChatGPT), the underlying [transformer architecture](https://learnopencv.com/attention-mechanism-in-transformer-neural-networks/) has allowed these systems to generate new text with remarkable accuracy over its predecessors.  This technology is being seen as a huge boon in the clinic, with use cases ranging from patient case summarization to drafting patient messages, saving clinical staff precious time.  

.  They've done well, At a time where clinicians are facing more burnout due to regulatory requirements, an aging population, and hospitals margins running thin, it is only natural to think that technology could be a true disruptor this time around.  


## Revolutionary vs. evolutionary technology
But could healthcare be disrupted in the same ways that Big Tech has done with other industries?  

Dr. Galvin goes on to say that "CHAT GPT 4 and other large learning and generative models are truly revolutionary, but change in clinical medical is always evolutionary".  In a previous [interview](https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.19.0619) with Dr. David Blumenthal and Dr. Namita Seth Mohta in 2019, they went on to highlight some of the challenges with new tech in healthcare:

> "Galvin:  Sometimes the unintended consequences exceed the benefits, to be honest. When you get into a system as big as health care, as resistant to change in health care, and inherently much more complicated, this is not buying goods and services over Amazon; this is not getting an Uber or using Lyft. These are in many cases very sick people with complicated diseases in a system that’s already very complicated.

> Blumenthal:  The 5% of patients who account for 50% of expenditures need continuous longitudinal care, comprehensive care, and care that’s knowledgeable about their complicated problems. Their simple problems are often complicated by their other conditions. So it’s hard to imagine solving our major health care issues, especially around cost, without developing effective systems for caring for that 5%. That’s where the money is, and it’s also where many of our quality and safety problems are, because those are the patients who are in constant contact with our health care system."

What does it mean for technology to be revolutionary vs. evolutionary?  

In an article written by Startup Nation

One might argue that the pandemic changed everything and we need the technology now more than ever.  But if we're honest, it just exacerbated the problems that were already there.  When I think of this very small margin of the population, these are not your higher socioeconomic individuals.  These make up the 95%, which the authors argue that technology will disrupt for everyday health concerns.  And certainly, there is value in that.

 So one has to think, who is this newest technology really benefitting?

CHAT GPT 4 and other large learning and generative models are truly revolutionary, but change in clinical medical is always evolutionary
