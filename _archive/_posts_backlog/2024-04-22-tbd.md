As I was putting together my last post, I realized I wanted to dedicate some more space to review transformer architectures.  More importantly, I wanted to understand why they have become so popular in healthcare recently.  While there are already plenty of great resources to learn about transformer architectures on the web, in this post I will rank my favorite resources from beginner to advanced level (think 100-400 level in Big Tech), and conclude with an application in healthcare. 

## Beginner 


## Intermediate

## Advanced

## Expert

## Why are transformers so powerful in healthcare?


## Conclusion
