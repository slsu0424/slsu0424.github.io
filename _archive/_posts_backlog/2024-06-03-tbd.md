After writing my last post, I was intrigued to learn a bit more about the black box phenomenon in AI models.  More pressing is understanding their implication for healthcare (perceived vs. actual).  This is not to say that AI has not already been embedded into medical products today, judging by the increasing number of FDA-approved AI algorithms.  However, I think it is important to understand the distinction of the algorithms embedded into such products.  In this post, I aim to provide a technical lens into this topic.  

## A database of FDA-approved AI algorithms
For those that are not aware, the FDA regularly tracks and publishes [AI/ML-enabled medical devices](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-aiml-enabled-medical-devices).  Fortunately, I was also able to dig up a 2020 article in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00324-0) which organizes these device algorithms into a database.  Although it looks like it has not been updated since mid-2021, it is still a good reference point.  First, let's take a look at the categories by which the FDA approves such devices:

In reviewing this [database](https://medicalfuturist.com/fda-approved-ai-based-algorithms), I decided to focus on algorithms focused on cardiology.  Eko Devices Inc. developed the Eko Analysis Software (EAS), which was approved by the FDA on January 15, 2020.  According to their [summary](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K192004) document, the tool is described as follows:

>The Eko Analysis Software is a cloud-based software API that allows a user to upload
synchronized ECG and heart sound/phonocardiogram (PCG) data for analysis. The software
uses several methods to interpret the acquired signals including signal processing and artificial
neural networks. The API can be electronically interfaced, and perform analysis with data
transferred from multiple mobile or computer based applications. 

I won't spend time focusing on signal processing, but will focus on the neural networks component.  

## Discriminative vs. Generative models
Neural networks fall into the category of generative models, in that 

## Is there value in explainable AI?

## Conclusion

I appreciated this insightful and hopeful article for the future of healthcare.  Perhaps with this new wave of AI, there is a renewed commitment by people and processes to enable a better healthcare experience for everyone.  Finally, may we put that old fax machine to rest.
