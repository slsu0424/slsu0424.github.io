June was a busy month, but I wanted to share some insights into year one of writing my blog, Health Tech Bytes.  In this post, I share my motivation for writing, important lessons I learned along the way, and what's next for year two.  I hope my journey is helpful for anyone looking for fresh ways to educate themselves, teach others, or find a passion project.


## Goal
I had toyed around with the idea of starting a blog for some time, but I never found the time to do it.  I now see why - blogging is a lot of work.  It is not for the faint of heart, so it is important to feel personally motivated to do it.  For me, I was learning a lot of new cool technology over the years, but I was also frustrated that I never had a chance to go really deep into any of it.  I often felt in operator mode, and there was a part of me that wanted to nerd out a bit, and spend time learning, thinking, asking.


## Lessons learned:
I wanted to document some of the things I discovered in this journey, some of which were surprising and fun, and others that were downright challenging.  Here are the top 10 things that come to mind:

### 1. Owning content  
I knew LinkedIn, Medium, and Substack were popular places for people to share their thoughts, but they didn't really own their content.  I wanted more control over the look and feel for my work, and chose to host my site using GitHub pages and Jekyll.  This took a bit of work in re-learning web development, but I've been pleased with the results.

### 2. Time and research, research, research  
Writing a blog post takes a lot of time, and a lot of research.  It takes a different set of skills to identify the topic you want to write about, and then find the information to substantiate it.  I often found myself digging around in LinkedIn and business journals to academic research papers and PhD blogs.

### 3. Less is more  
Did you know that a blog post that reads between 5-7 minutes has the highest level of engagement?  This required being able to explore a topic with enough depth, without completely losing your audience.  There were some posts I would have loved to expand in detail, but I ended up having to delegate further discussion in a link or leave it out completely. 

### 4. Tech tutorials are hard
Perhaps my least favorite was writing the technical tutorials.  The coding part was easy, but it was way harder to explain it.  The task of synthesizing technical information and distilling it down for the everyday reader takes a lot more time than you realize.

### 5. Finding your voice  
One thing I had often read with writing is that the author eventually finds their voice.  Are you more creative or demure?  More business-oriented or research-focused?  I liked to err on the side of being as factual as possible, research extensively to substantiate any claims I was making.

### 6. The post where I learned the most
When I survey the different topics I wrote about, I ended up learning the most from my post on word embeddings.  It turned out to be my longest post (14 minutes to read), and the longest one to develop.  It really forced me to understand one of the key building blocks of deep learning frameworks.

### 7. Sources of inspiration  
I was actually surprised that I found a lot of inspiration in music.  I really identified with the creative process involved in making music, which I would often find in videos.  What you often see in a final performance is the result of many hours of composition, practice, and revisions behind the scenes.  

### 8. Surprises during the writing process  
There were some writings that were a straight divulge of thoughts.  But there were others that were painfully slow, where I dreaded having to do the research, rethink what I wanted to say, or go through the revision process.  The final result was always satisfying, but the journey to get had its ups and downs.

### 9. ChatGPT lives up to its hype, at least for productivity  
I'd have to imagine that writing without ChatGPT was way harder a few years ago.  To that end, the tool is living up to its name.  I found it super helpful, especially when it came to learning deep technical topics quickly.  I was amazed how fast it surfaced (mostly) relevant information; as such, it helped speed up my research process.  

### 10. Finding the middle ground  
I knew when I started writing that I wanted it to be more substantial than a short post on LinkedIn, but I also did not want it to become a full-blown research paper.  I also had a target to publish a post once a month.  I recognize there are people who write pieces much more often than that, and I give huge kudos to them.

## What's next
Athough I am embarking on a new journey soon, I have an ever-growing list of topics I would like to explore in the next year.  Due to time limitation, I may have to change up the form.

## Conclusion
I've really enjoyed my year where I could dedicate substantial time to write.
