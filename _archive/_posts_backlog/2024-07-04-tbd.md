June was a busy month, but I wanted to share some insights into year one of writing my blog, Health Tech Bytes.  In this post, I share my motivation for writing, important lessons I learned along the way, and what's next for year two.  I hope my journey is helpful for anyone looking for fresh ways to educate themselves, teach others, or find a passion project.

## Goal
I had toyed around with the idea of starting a blog for some time, but I never found the time to do it.  I now see why - blogging is a lot of work.  It is not for the faint of heart, so it is important to feel personally motivated to do it.  I was learning a lot of new cool technology over the years, but I never had a chance to go really deep into any of it.  I also wanted to further explore healthcare issues that continue to plague this country, irregardless of what technology is available.  I wanted to nerd out a bit and spend time to learn, think, ask all of the hard questions.

## Lessons learned:
I wanted to document some of the things I discovered in this journey, some of which were surprising and fun, and others that were downright challenging.  Here are the top things that come to mind:

### 1. Owning content 
I knew LinkedIn, Medium, and Substack were popular places for people to share their thoughts, but they didn't really own their content.  I wanted more control over the look and feel for my work, and chose to host my site using GitHub pages and Jekyll.  This took a bit of work in re-learning web development, but I enjoyed the process.

### 2. Time and research, research, research  
Writing a quality blog post takes a lot of time, and a lot of research.  It takes a different set of skills to identify the topic you want to write about, and then find the information to substantiate it.  I often found myself digging around in LinkedIn and business journals to academic research papers and PhD blogs.  ChatGPT helped me a lot here.

### 3. Less is more  
Did you know that a blog post that reads between 5-7 minutes has the highest level of engagement?  This requires being able to explore a topic with enough depth, without completely losing your audience.  There were some posts I would have loved to expand in detail, but I ended up having to delegate further discussion in a link or leave it out completely. 

### 4. Tech tutorials are hard
Perhaps my least favorite was writing the technical tutorials.  The coding part was easy, but it was way harder to explain it.  The task of synthesizing technical information for the everyday reader is a bit of an art, and takes a lot more time than you realize.

### 6. Know how much time you will commit
I wanted my writing to be more substantial than a LinkedIn post, but I also did not want it to become a research paper (there is value in both).  I set a modest target, which was to publish once a month.  A big thumbs up to those who write much more often than that, and I can only hope to have that level of commitment.

### 7. The post where I learned the most
When I survey the different topics I wrote about, I ended up learning the most from my post on word embeddings.  It turned out to be my longest post (14 minutes to read), and ironically, the most annoying one to develop.  It really forced me to understand one of the key building blocks of deep learning frameworks.

### 8. Sources of inspiration  
I was actually surprised that I found a lot of inspiration in music.  I really identified with the creative process involved in making music, which I would often find in videos.  What you often see in a final performance is the result of many hours of composition, practice, and revisions behind the scenes.  

## What's next
Athough I am embarking on a new journey soon, I have an ever-growing list of topics I would like to explore in the next year.  There are so many facets to healthcare and technology, especially with AI becoming mainstream.  I'll also be experimenting with writing shorter articles, and hopefully writing more frequently.  Due to time constraints, I don't forsee the ability to go as in-depth as I would like to.  However, I am committed to being consistent.

## Conclusion
I've enjoyed this time where I could dedicate a substantial amount of time to write.  I've learned a ton, and don't want to let the knowledge I acquired to go to waste.  Here's to another year of writing and growing.
