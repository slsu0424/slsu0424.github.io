I had not explored too much into AI ethics and regulation as of late, but I was intrigued by this [article] by Politico 

## Goal

## Lessons learned:

- Surprises during the writing process
- finding your voice
- the post I learned the most from
- finding sources of inspiration

## What's next



## Conclusion
Throughout this recent journey in researching the societal effects of AI in healthcare, its become clear that we are navigating choppy waters with the rapid development of AI.  I remain optimistic that with consensus-built AI standards, there will be more (rightful) scrutiny from every angle.  Its not out of reach to say that AI can improve health outcomes for all, but implementing it will require investment across the ecosystem.
