June was a busy month, but I had it on my mind to share a reflection once I hit one year of writing my blog, Health Tech Bytes.  In this post, I share my motivation for writing, important lessons I learned along the way, and what's next for year two.  I hope this journey is helpful for anyone looking for fresh ways to educate themselves, teach others, or find something they are passionate about.

## Goal
I had toyed around with the idea of starting a blog for some time, but I never found the time to do it.  I now see why - blogging is a lot of work.  Its not for the faint of heart, so its important to feel personally motivated to do it.  For me, I was learning a lot of new cool technology over the years, but I was also frustrated that I never had a chance to go really deep into any of it.  I often felt in operator mode, and there was a part of me that wanted to nerd out a bit and just spend time learning, thinking, asking.  I felt that if I could write about it, and communicate it to a novice, then I would feel a sense of accomplishment.

## Lessons learned:
I wanted to document some of the things I discovered in this journey, some of which were surprising and fun, and others that were more challenging than I had anticipated.  Here are the top things that came to mind:

1. Owning content
One of the initial dilemmas I came across was where to host my writings.  I knew LinkedIn, Medium, and Substack were popular places for people to share their thoughts and blogs, but they didn't really own their content.  I personally did not like this idea, because what if one of these sites were to disappear?  I also wanted more control over the look and feel for my content.  Thus I chose to host my site on GitHub, using GitHub pages and a Jekyll plug-in as a front-end.  This took a bit of work in re-learning web development, but I've been happy with the results.

2. Time and research, research, research
This was a big one for me.  Writing a blog post takes a lot of time, and a lot of research.  It takes a different set of skills to identify the topic you want to write about, and then go find the information to substantiate it.  The research part was interesting, because I often found myself digging around in LinkedIn and business journals to academic research papers and PhD blogs.  The next task was synthesizing this information and distilling it down for the everyday reader.  This was especially challenging for technical topics.

3. Less is more
Did you know that a blog post that reads between 5-7 minutes has the highest level of engagement (link)?  This was a real challenge because this required being able to explore a topic with enough depth, without completely losing your audience.  There were some posts I would have loved to expand in detail, but it was a deliberate choice to keep it consumable.  I ended up having to delegate further discussion in a link or leave it out completely. 

4. Tech tutorials are hard
Perhaps my least favorite was writing the technical tutorials.  But don't get me wrong, I still like coding.  Interestingly enough, I initially started with technical writings for the first 6 months or so, before switching over to more business-oriented writings the last 6 months.  I found that the coding part was easy, but it was way harder to explain it.  Along with point 3, being able to convey key concepts using fewer words was more difficult than I realized.  However, I would also say there is no substitute for hands-on learning.

5. Finding your voice
One thing I had often read with writing is that the author eventually finds their voice.  I had no idea what this meant, but I suppose its the idea that as you continue to write, you will recognize that you have a certain style in how you come across in your writing.  Are you more creative or demure?  More business-oriented or research-focused?  For me, I would say that I liked to err on the side of being as grounded as possible, and would often find myself researching to make sure any claim I made was substantiated.

6. The post I learned the most from
When I survey the different types of topics I wrote about this past year, I ended up learning the most from my post on word embeddings.  It turned out to be my longest post (14 minutes to read), and quite possibly the most annoying one to develop.  I remember spending up to 2 weeks putting this together.  It really forced me to understand one of the key building blocks of deep learning frameworks.  As a result, I feel I have a firmer understanding of why AI has become so powerful in recent years.  

7. Sources of inspiration
I was actually surprised that I found a lot of inspiration in music.  One would think that reading other blogs would serve that purpose, but they did not.  I really identified with the creative process involved in making music, which I would often find in videos.  What you often see in a final performance is the result of many hours of creating, practicing, and revising behind the scenes.  There is also something so beautiful about creating something from nothing.   

8. Surprises during the writing process
There were some writings that went by fast (like this one).  But there were others that were painfully slow, where I dreaded having to do the research, rethink what I wanted to say, or go through the revision process.  In the end, I was happy with what I created, but sometimes the journey to get there was a bit windy.

9. ChatGPT lives up to its hype, at least for productivity
I'd imagine that writing

## What's next



## Conclusion
Throughout this recent journey in researching the societal effects of AI in healthcare, its become clear that we are navigating choppy waters with the rapid development of AI.  I remain optimistic that with consensus-built AI standards, there will be more (rightful) scrutiny from every angle.  Its not out of reach to say that AI can improve health outcomes for all, but implementing it will require investment across the ecosystem.
