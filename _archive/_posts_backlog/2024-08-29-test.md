Lately, I've been reading a lot about environmental factors affecting healthcare, or what is commonly considered social determinants of health (SDOH).  Things such as one's financial situation, social circles, and places where we live, work, and play.  Interestingly, I came across a recent paper from my professional network which highlights the fact that these non-clinical factors play a much bigger role in a person's health outcome than utilizing the healthcare system's services.... In this post, I take a look at the government initiative for health and an exciting paper using LLMs to mine for SDOH in electronic health records.  

## White House Healthy People 2030
I had toyed around with the idea of starting a blog for some time, but I never found the time to do it.  I now see why - blogging is a lot of work.  It is not for the faint of heart, so it is important to feel personally motivated to do it.  I was learning a lot of new technologies over the years, but it was increasingly harder to go in-depth into any of it.  I was also becoming increasingly aware and frustrated by persistent healthcare issues (e.g., access, quality), irregardless of what new technology was available.  I wanted an avenue to learn, think, and ask the hard questions.

## Conclusion
I underestimated how much time writing a blog post would take, but the process of putting fingers to keyboard often began with: What did I want to learn next?  What did I read that was interesting or troubling to me and why?  Why now?  I learned that writing is not just a wonderful outlet for career growth, but for personal growth as well.  Here's looking forward to another year of finding the next tech innovations for health.
