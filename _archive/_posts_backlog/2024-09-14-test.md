Have you ever had something that was an indespensible part of your life?  Much like a cup of coffee or a cell phone, I've recently found myself using ChatGPT as if it was completely indepensible -  *I don't even give it a second thought*.  It's a scary prospect.  Similar to most frequent users of ChatGPT, I've been impressed with how natural the conversation flows, and the (perceived) intuition of the system is remarkable.  Even more so is its ability to explain its reasoning to me in human-like form.  A thought came to mind was 'What would this be like for someone in the healthcare field?  As I've been studying generative AI systems in-depth, I wanted to explore the concept of Chain-of-Thought prompting.  I came across this topic in one of my earlier posts, and its worth a revisit considering its potential impacts for healthcare.

## What are the origins of chain-of-thought? 
My research pointed me to a landmark paper published in 2022

What's interesting is that as humans, we naturally gravitate and adapt to such technologies over time. 

## CoT prompting considerations for healthcare

## Conclusion
In this post, I reviewed SDoH as a key set of non-clinical factors affecting health outcomes.  Such health disparities were brought to light during the COVID-19 pandemic, and became an area of focus for the White House Healthy People 2030 initiative.  Recent AI advances, particularly LLMs, have demonstrated the capability to effectively mine data sources for SDoH evidence.  I remain bullish that these technologies can provide better insights and tailored treatments for at-risk patients.
