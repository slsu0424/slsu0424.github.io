<p>Welcome, I'm Sandy.</p>
  
<p>I am a cloud architect, data science and AI practitioner, and health informatics strategist.  This is a professional site to share my learnings on the evolving landscape of technology in healthcare.</p>

<p>My background spans nearly two decades covering the healthcare/life sciences industry at Johnson & Johnson, IBM Watson Health, Cloudera, and Microsoft.  I found my passion in building and delivering solutions, working on technologies ranging from databases to big data to AI.  During this time, I also found myself fascinated by the complexities of the US healthcare system.</p>

<p>I also came to appreciate the capabilities of emerging technologies, and the lessons learned in bringing these to market.  I am optimistic about technologies that will change the way healthcare data is used.  Yet I believe it is more important to examine how and where such technology should be used.</p> 

<p>Advances in computing enable us to reimagine healthcare, and I dream of a future with better healthcare innovation and patient outcomes.</p>
