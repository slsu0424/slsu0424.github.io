<p>Hi, I'm Sandy.</p>
  
<p>I am a cloud architect, data science and AI practitioner, and healthcare informatics enthusiast.  This site is a creative outlet to share my thoughts on the evolving landscape of technology in healthcare.</p>

<p>My background spans nearly two decades in the healthcare/life sciences industry at Johnson & Johnson, IBM Watson Health, Cloudera, and Microsoft.  I studied management science & information systems, and obtained my master's in clinical informatics management.</p> 

<p>I grew to love technology over the years, and my most memorable experiences have been creating solutions that delight and surprise.  I've been amazed at the power of computers and programming - and only expect that this will continue to grow.</p>

<p>I believe the intersection of technology, health, and policy can make the system better for patients, payers, and providers.</p>
