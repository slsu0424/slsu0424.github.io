<p>Hi, I'm Sandy.
<br>
I am a cloud architect, data science and AI practitioner, and healthcare informatics enthusiast.  This site is a creative outlet to share my thoughts on the evolving landscape of technology in healthcare.
<br>
My background spans nearly two decades in the healthcare/life sciences industry at Johnson & Johnson, IBM Watson Health, Cloudera, and Microsoft.  Two decades ago, AI didn't even exist as a major, so I studied management science & information systems.  I later obtained my master's in clinical informatics management. 
<br> 
I grew to love technology over the years, and my most memorable experiences have been creating magic.  I've surprised myself and others with the power of computers and programming - and I hope to keep learning it for years to come.
<br>
I dream of a future where my passion for technology, health, and well-being can make the US healthcare system better.
<br>
Thanks for stopping by.
