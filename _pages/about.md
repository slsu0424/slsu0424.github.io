<p>Welcome, I'm Sandy.</p>
  
<p>I am a healthcare technology advisor. cloud architect, and data science and AI practitioner.  This site is to share my learnings on the evolving landscape of information technology in healthcare.</p>

<p>My background spans more than two decades covering the healthcare/life sciences industry at Johnson & Johnson, IBM Watson Health, Cloudera, and Microsoft.  I found my passion in tinkering with and building software, first developing database systems to working on cloud platforms specializing in big data/AI.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in emerging technologies, and their potential to improve healthcare.  These offerings can be considered revolutionary, yet their adoption must be purposeful and accessible.</p> 

<p>Advances in computing enable us to reimagine healthcare, and I dream of a better future for healthcare innovation and patient outcomes.</p> 

<p>All views represented here are my own.</p>
