<p>Welcome, I'm Sandy.</p>
  
<p>I am a cloud architect, data science and AI practitioner, and health informatics strategist.  This is a professional site to share my learnings on the evolving landscape of technology in healthcare.</p>

<p>My background spans nearly two decades covering the healthcare/life sciences industry at Johnson & Johnson, IBM Watson Health, Cloudera, and Microsoft.  I found my niche in building solutions, working on technologies such as databases and SaaS to big data and AI.  I also learned the complexities of the US healthcare system, and the challenges of bringing these solutions to market.</p>

<p>I am particularly passionate about emerging technologies, and how they will change the way healthcare data is used.  Yet I believe it is more important to examine how and where such technology should be used.</p> 

<p>Advances in computing enable us to reimagine healthcare, and I dream of a future with better healthcare innovation and patient outcomes.</p> 

<p>All views represented here are my own.</p>
