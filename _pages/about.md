<p>Welcome, I'm Sandy.</p>
  
<p>I am a cloud architect, data science and AI practitioner, and health informatics strategist.  This site is to share my learnings on the evolving landscape of technology in healthcare.</p>

<p>My background spans two decades covering the healthcare/life sciences industry at Johnson & Johnson, IBM Watson Health, Cloudera, and Microsoft.  I found my passion in building solutions, working with databases and SaaS to big data and AI.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in emerging technologies, and their potential to improve healthcare.  While these offerings can be revolutionary, their adoption must be purposeful and accessible.</p> 

<p>Advances in computing enable us to reimagine healthcare, and I dream of a better future for healthcare innovation and patient outcomes.</p> 

<p>All views represented here are my own.</p>
