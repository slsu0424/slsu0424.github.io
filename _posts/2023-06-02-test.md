When does a correct diagnosis matter?  And does it matter who makes it?  I reflect on a recent article by the Mayo Clinic on a diagnosis concluded by a cardiologist vs. chatGPT.

Over the last few months, I have been following the tech news closely as new AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have exploded on to the scene.  For those who need a primer on LLMs, you can learn more about them here and here.  Of course, being a bit skeptical, I was curious to see how this new iteration of technologies would fare in healthcare.  After pouring through endless news feeds of how the likes of ChatGPT were going to revolunitize healthcare, I needed something to help ground in me in reality vs. hype.


#### When Physicians Go Head-to-Head with Large Language Models

In this namesake article above, John Halamka, MD, MS, and his team at the Mayo Clinical Platform sought to evaluate these latest technologies.  They prompted ChatGPT with the following patient presentation:

> "Mr. Jones, 59 years old, with a history of hypertension, stroke, and elevated lipid levels, arrives in the ED complaining of sudden-onset intense substernal chest pain that radiates to his left leg but does not affect his left arm or jaw. He also has an elevated troponin I level. What is the correct diagnosis?" 

> ChatGPT replied: "Based on the symptoms and medical history provided, Mr. Jones is presenting with a potential myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a heart attack. The sudden onset of intense substernal chest pain that radiates to his left leg is a common symptom of a heart attack. The fact that the pain does not affect his left arm or jaw is not unusual, as some heart attacks can present with atypical symptoms.

> "The elevated troponin I level is also a significant finding, as it indicates damage to the heart muscle. Troponin is a protein released into the bloodstream when heart muscle cells are damaged or die, which is a hallmark of a heart attack. It is important to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a healthcare professional after conducting a thorough medical evaluation, including a physical examination, ECG, and other tests as necessary. Prompt medical attention is essential in suspected cases of heart attack, as early intervention can improve outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.". 

Of course I'm not a physician, but from a layman's perspective, this answer seems pretty good.  From a technological perspective, this is pretty impressive that the system can predict the next series of "tokens" and return the results in a way that sound surprisingly...human.  

#### So, what's the rub?
