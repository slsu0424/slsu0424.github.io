Last month, I gave a [talk](https://www.meetup.com/new-jersey-sql-data-platform-user-group/events/294231326/) at a local meetup group 
on LLMs, LangChain & SQL.  Since then, I've wanted to dig a little deeper into the technical foundations of LLMs, and why they are so popular these days.  

This article will begin a series of technical tutorials that are geared towards healthcare care use cases.  While there is no shortage of resources to learn about NLP and the latest ML approaches, my focus will be to reinforce technical concepts I am not as familiar with.

## Goal of NLP - converting text data into a format that computers can understand

As I build up my knowledge on deep learning, I wanted to backtrack where LLMs came from.  To start, LLMs are a type of neural network.  A neural network is a type of machine learning approach that has produced very high performance, and is well suited for [NLP tasks](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1204/#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20deep%20learning%20%28or%20neural%20network%29,that%20do%20not%20require%20traditional%2C%20task-specific%20feature%20engineering)

The [goal of NLP](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes01-wordvecs1.pdf) is to enable computers to "understand" natural language in order to perform some task.  In order to do so, natural language (text format) has to be converted into a numerical format.



## Special formatting

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*


## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<li class="ml-1 mr-1">
    <a target="_blank" href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### CSS

```css
.highlight .c {
    color: #999988;
    font-style: italic; 
}
.highlight .err {
    color: #a61717;
    background-color: #e3d2d2; 
}
```

#### JS

```js
// alertbar later
$(document).scroll(function () {
    var y = $(this).scrollTop();
    if (y > 280) {
        $('.alertbar').fadeIn();
    } else {
        $('.alertbar').fadeOut();
    }
});
```

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

#### C

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
