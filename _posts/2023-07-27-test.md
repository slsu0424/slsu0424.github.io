Last month, I gave a [talk](https://www.meetup.com/new-jersey-sql-data-platform-user-group/events/294231326/) at a local meetup group 
on LLMs, LangChain & SQL.  Since then, I've wanted to dig a little deeper into the technical foundations of LLMs.

This article will begin a series of technical tutorials that are geared towards healthcare care use cases.  While there is no shortage of resources to learn about NLP and the latest ML approaches, my focus will be to reinforce technical concepts I am not as familiar with.


## NLP - converting text data into a format that computers can understand

To start, I wanted to backtrack where LLMs came from.  LLMs are a type of neural network.  A neural network is a type of machine learning approach that has been shown to perform well on NLP tasks.  For a good overview of NLP, check out this [guide](https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing).

The [goal of NLP](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes01-wordvecs1.pdf) is to enable computers to "understand" natural language in order to perform some task, such as sentiment analysis.  In order to do so, natural language (text format) needs to be converted (encode) into a numerical format.

There are numerous approaches to encode text, or words.  One of the simplest approaches is to generate a [one-hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot) vector (1 x N matrix) that will distinguish a word from every other word in a vocabulary.  This [tutorial](https://gyan-mittal.com/nlp-ai-ml/nlp-word-encoding-by-one-hot-encoding/) does a really good job explaining how this works when applied to documents.   

## Let's convert a few PubMed abstracts to vectors

To put the above tutorial into practice, I thought I would give this a try with a few [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) abstracts.  Let's say that we want to perform an NLP task on papers that discuss Type 2 diabetes.  This is what my query and results look like in PubMed:

## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<li class="ml-1 mr-1">
    <a target="_blank" href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### CSS

```css
.highlight .c {
    color: #999988;
    font-style: italic; 
}
.highlight .err {
    color: #a61717;
    background-color: #e3d2d2; 
}
```

#### JS

```js
// alertbar later
$(document).scroll(function () {
    var y = $(this).scrollTop();
    if (y > 280) {
        $('.alertbar').fadeIn();
    } else {
        $('.alertbar').fadeOut();
    }
});
```

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

#### C

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
