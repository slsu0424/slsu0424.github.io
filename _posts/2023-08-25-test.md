VC firm Andressen Horowitz recently published an interesting [article](https://a16z.com/2023/08/02/where-will-ai-have-the-biggest-impact-healthcare/) on the new(est) AI technologies that will have a big impact on healthcare.  My first reaction was 'Haven't we seen this before?' and 'What makes things different *this* time around?'  While I see great potential, I remain cautious for AI to have as much impact in a field where human connection is vital.

## Don't give me more software, give me more productivity

I love new technology.  I love it because it makes me more productive.  As I was booking holiday travel recently, I realized how *easy* it has become to do things on my own - on my own time, in my own way.  No calling a travel agent to arrange a trip.  Not having to wonder if I could find a better deal with another agent.  No looking at a paper map to find directions to the hotel. I don't think you'll find too many people who will complain about the convenience this provides (sans, the Uber driver who cancels my ride because I live in a congested island).      

What's funny is that we are using new software all the time.  Everytime a new app comes out, we can easily download it and check it out.  Its integrated seamlessly into our everyday life; that is, it makes my life better.

Healthcare seems to have gotten it backwards, as every new healthcare software solution promises more productivity, but instead does the opposite.  EHRs require more clicks for physicians.  For patients, my personal favorite (annoyance) is when I am asked to fill out insurance information in the EHR before my next appointment, even though I provided it at the previous appoitnment.  Better yet is when I am asked to fill out the same insurance information - on paper - in the doctor's office.  So, why bother filling out anything online?

That's not productivity.

Certainly there is an allure to their statement that instead of healthtech companies developing new software, they'll develop ”AI ‘people’ who are cheap, fast, cheerful and empathic.”  However, if I'm a patient, I want a human being to help me feel better.  The thought of a machine having perceived empathy discounts the notion of seeing a doctor at all.

A good piece of software is one that will handle the simple things like document capture, reconciliation, etc.  I agree wih the article that the first revolution will be non-clinical use cases.  If AI can help us get past that hurdle, then I think we have achieved productivity.

## Marginal improvements are not worth the effort

I don't agree with this statement.  Having worked in high-tech technical roles over the last decade, I have seen the evolution of more advanced computing and its capabilities.  Having been part of an IBM Watson commercialization team, it is amazing how many computational advancements have been made to make cognitive computing more realistic.  Working in big data and cloud platforms have shown the ability to create immensely powerful solutions with seemingly limitless compute power.  One may even argue that Again, it goes back to the first idea of increased productivity.

However, I do not advocate for this in healthcare.  Yes, cloud computing offers 

## Everyone has a world-class doctor in our pocket, right?

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*


## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<li class="ml-1 mr-1">
    <a target="_blank" href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### CSS

```css
.highlight .c {
    color: #999988;
    font-style: italic; 
}
.highlight .err {
    color: #a61717;
    background-color: #e3d2d2; 
}
```

#### JS

```js
// alertbar later
$(document).scroll(function () {
    var y = $(this).scrollTop();
    if (y > 280) {
        $('.alertbar').fadeIn();
    } else {
        $('.alertbar').fadeOut();
    }
});
```

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

#### C

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
