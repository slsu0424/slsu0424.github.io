"Switchover disruptions" was highlighted in Harvard Business Review's recent [article](https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-adoption-in-u-s-health-care-wont-be-easy) on the challenges of AI adoption in healthcare.  [Economists](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.4.3.1) define it as the cost of integrating new technologies that can dampen an organization's profits.

This prompted me to examine the ways in which this new wave of AI (generative AI) can minimize such disruptions, and if this type of AI is worth the tradeoff.  

## The unsettling case of high switchover disruption: EHRs

I was fascinated by the article's comparison of 2 new technologies that arrived in healthcare: EHRs vs. new surgical technique to remove the gallbladder.  EHRs faced strong resistance, until the Obama administration stepped in to [incentivize](https://www.hipaajournal.com/what-is-the-hitech-act/#:~:text=The%20HITECH%20Act%20was%20created%20to%20promote%20and,%28HIPAA%29%20by%20tightening%20up%20the%20language%20of%20HIPAA.) organizations to go digital.  The new (minimally invasive) surgical technique faced the opposite - low switchover disruption - physician adoption was easier and limited.  

The key?  Hospitals and surgeons were *already in the business* of removing gallbladders.

When I think about EHRs, this should have been an easy "win".  Why wouldn't a patient want to see all their medical information stored in one place?  Why wouldn't a physician want to see a more complete view of their patient's health?  In all other industries where digitization has led to improved efficiency, the complete opposite happened with EHRs.  Perhaps we were not aligned on improving healthcare outcomes after all.

I agree that the issue came down to control.  It is quite unsettling to know that...
Will the same fate await this next wave of AI?

## The most plausible genAI use case: Medical Scribe

The arrival of chatGPT has created a dizzying revival for using AI in healthcare, with the promise of automated diagnosis and treatments (sounds problematic already).  This, by the way, were the same statements touted by IBM Watson a decade ago.    

## The true cost of running LLMs

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

## Conclusion

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.
