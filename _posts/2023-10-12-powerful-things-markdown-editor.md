"Switchover disruptions" was highlighted in HBR's recent [article](https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-adoption-in-u-s-health-care-wont-be-easy) on the challenges of AI adoption in healthcare.  According to the [American Economic Journal: Microeconomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.4.3.1), it describes the costs of integrating new technologies that can dampen an organization's profits.

It made me examine the ways in which AI *can* minimize such disruptions, and *if* the type of AI is worth the tradeoff.

The arrival of chatGPT has created a dizzying revival for using AI in healthcare, with the promise of automated diagnosis and treatments (sounds scary already).  

## The true cost of running LLMs

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.
