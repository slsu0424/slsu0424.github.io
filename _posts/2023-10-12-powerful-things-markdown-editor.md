"Switchover disruptions" was highlighted in Harvard Business Review's recent [article](https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-adoption-in-u-s-health-care-wont-be-easy) on the challenges of AI adoption in healthcare.  According to [economists](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.4.3.1), it describes the cost of integrating new technologies that can dampen an organization's profits.

It made me examine the ways in which this new wave of AI *can* minimize such disruptions, and *if* this type of AI is worth the tradeoff.  

## The sad case of high switchover disruption: EHRs

I was fascinated by the article's comparison of 2 new technologies that arrived in healthcare: EHRs and a minimally invasive surgical technique to remove the gallbladder.  EHRs faced strong resistance, until the Obama administration stepped in to incentivize organizations to go digital.  The new surgical technique faced the opposite - low switchover disruption - physician adoption was easier and limited.  

The key?  Hospitals and surgeons were already in the business of removing gallbladders.

When I think about EHRs, this should have been an easy "win".  Why wouldn't a patient want to see all their medical information stored in one place?  Why wouldn't a physician want to see a more complete view of their patient's health?  In all other industries where digitization has led to improved efficiency, perhaps we were not for the common goal of improved healthcare outcomes after all.

I agree with the authors that the issue came down to control.  Will the same fate await this next wave of AI?

## The most plausible genAI use case: Medical Scribe

The arrival of chatGPT has created a dizzying revival for using AI in healthcare, with the promise of automated diagnosis and treatments (sounds scary already).  

## The true cost of running LLMs

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

## Conclusion

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.
