"Switchover disruptions" were highlighted in Harvard Business Review's recent [article](https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-adoption-in-u-s-health-care-wont-be-easy) on the challenges of AI adoption in healthcare.  [Economists](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.4.3.1) define it as the cost of integrating new technologies that can dampen an organization's profits.

This prompted me to examine the ways in which this new wave of AI can minimize such disruptions, and if this type of AI is worth the tradeoff.  

## The unsettling case of high switchover disruption: EHRs

I was fascinated by the article's comparison of 2 new technologies that arrived in healthcare: EHRs vs. new surgical technique to remove the gallbladder.  EHRs faced strong resistance, until the Obama administration stepped in to [incentivize](https://www.hipaajournal.com/what-is-the-hitech-act/#:~:text=The%20HITECH%20Act%20was%20created%20to%20promote%20and,%28HIPAA%29%20by%20tightening%20up%20the%20language%20of%20HIPAA.) organizations to go digital.  The new (minimally invasive) surgical technique faced a low switchover disruption - physician adoption was easier.  

The key?  Hospitals and surgeons were *already in the business* of removing gallbladders.

EHRs should have been an easy win.  Why wouldn't a patient want to see all their medical information stored in one place?  Why wouldn't a physician want to see a more complete view of their patient's health?  In all other industries where digitization has led to improved efficiency, the complete opposite happened with EHRs.  Perhaps we were not aligned on improving healthcare outcomes after all.

I agree that the issue came down to control.  It is quite unsettling (but not surprising in a capitalist society) to know that there are power struggles between physicians, payers, and government.  But guess who loses out in the end?  The patient.  

Will the same fate await this next wave of AI?

## The most plausible genAI use case: Medical Scribe

The arrival of chatGPT has created a dizzying revival for using AI in healthcare, with the promise of automated diagnosis and treatments.  This, by the way, were the same statements touted by [IBM Watson](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-ibm-watson-overpromised-and-underdelivered-on-ai-health-care) a decade ago.  Granted that today's AI technology has improved over its predecessors, that doesn't matter unless it can prove its business value.  "Prove to me that it will actually do something usefulâ€”that it will make my life better, and my patients' lives better.", stated Martin Kohn (former IBM Research chief medical scientist), and that still rings true today.

Today's AI systems can do something useful - work as a medical scribe.  Unfortunately, one of the ill by-products of digitization is increased [administrative burden](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/top-challenges-2021-1-administrative-burdens-and-paperwork) placed upon healthcare providers.  If a technology can help reduce this burden, providers will have more face-to-face time with patients, and increase productivity (i.e., make a practice more profitable).  I think more physicians would be on board with this.  In addition,  

Although this is less glamorous than diagnosing and treating patients, I think this is probably the best place for AI.  It may be the only place where AI can properly function, without jeopardizing the existing power dynamics among health entities and the government.  


## The true cost of running LLMs

While these next-gen AI models have demonstrated remarkable performance in terms of human comprehension, they are not cheap to run.  The Wall Street Journal ran a recent piece on the

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.
