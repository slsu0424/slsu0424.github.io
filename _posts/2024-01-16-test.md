Its a New Year, and with it, we embark on the yearly tradition of resolutions.  What is top of mind for US adults in 2024?  According to a [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/new-years-resolutions-statistics/) survey of 1000 people, improving fitness is the #1 resolution (48%).  Rounding out the top 5 resolutions, 3 were related to physical/mental health.  Yet, the US continues to grow its healthcare costs with worse health outcomes than every other industrialized nation.

#### Poor health outcomes still plague the US

According to the [Peterson Center-KFF Health System Tracker](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/#Life%20expectancy%20and%20per%20capita%20healthcare%20spending%20(PPP%20adjusted),%202021), in 2021, the US spent over $4,000 more per capita on healthcare than the next highest spending country:

I am not a health economist, but I am challenging myself to have a better understanding of the economics and policies that shape the US healthcare today.  This comes from my own experiences as a patient navigating the healthcare system, and as a technologist specialized in bringing data and systems together.  

reorienting myself to the complexities of systems that still don't talk to each other.

A few months ago, the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/08/who-profits-most-from-americas-baffling-health-care-system) provided some more analysis into the recent cost drivers of the US healthcare system, focusing on 3rd party brokers (i.e., insurance) vs. pharmaceutical companies and health systems.  

The questions remain: Will costs go up/down?  Will health outcomes improve?  What role does technology play?

#### 2023 was a big year for consolidation

2023 was not only a big year for new technology (generative AI), it was also a big year for healthcare mergers.  According to the Economist, most of this activity involved verticalization by health insurance companies.  For example...

#### GenAI is a hit, but has limited use cases in healthcare 

One thing to note is that LLMs are limited by their tendency to [hallucinate](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination).  It means that a generative AI system can output novel text that sound completely plausible, but are factually incorrect.  Currently, there are more focused LLMs trained on the medical domain that are under development, with the idea that narrower models may mitigate these hallucinations.

Despite these limitations, I agree with the authors that LLMs still have value in healthcare.  My key takeaways:
* ChatGPT may be better suited to situations where common medical conditions are seen and have a standard treatment plan (i.e., primary care) 
* Automating common cases can free up physician time for more complex cases or other tasks
* In complex clinical cases, employing human reasoning and intuition can mean life or death for a patient 

Lastly, I would argue that most physicians aim to establish a trust relationship with their patients, mutually working towards the best possible outcome.  This type of relationship fails to exist between a human and a computer.
