For 2024, I'm going to be switching up some of my posts to focus a bit more on the healthcare industry and current trends.  2023 was a fun time exploring the newest toy in tech (generative AI), but it also came with its share of optimists and pessimists/realists when talking tech in healthcare.  I thought it warranted deeper inspection beyond the technology itself, which I will attempt to explore from various angles in separate posts.

#### Poor health outcomes still plague the US

The current tech buzz reminds me of the time almost a decade ago when IBM Watson Health aimed to [transform healthcare](https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/10/ibm-watson-health-sale-lessons/), to much fanfare and eventual sell-off.

For such a vision, have we gotten any better since that time?

According to the [Peterson Center-KFF Health System Tracker](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/#Life%20expectancy%20and%20per%20capita%20healthcare%20spending%20(PPP%20adjusted),%202022), in 2022, the US life expectancy at birth still lagged behind its peer countries:

Now let's look at health expenditures: In 2022, the US spent over $4,000 more per capita (per person) on healthcare than the next highest spending country (Germany).  Note that the US life expectancy still ranks the lowest amongst comparable countries.

If we look more deeply into *whom* is consuming the majority of US healthcare services, a 2021 report showed that greater than 50% of the overall healthcare spend is attributed to people 55 and up:

When we look at these stats compared to other countries, I found it striking that despite all the technological advances that our economy produces - [the US is #1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-produce-best-software-222422955.html) when it comes to producing software engineers) - US health outcomes still fare worse than our neighbors.

The above data would suggest a clear answer to my question: No, we have not gotten better over the last decade.

So what gives?

I am not a health economist, but I am reorienting myself to understand the economics and policies that shape our healthcare system today.  I am increasingly aware of the shortfalls encountered in fixing healthcare, and have tempered my expectations of what technology can/cannot do.  This comes from my own experiences as a patient, conversations with health providers, and as a technologist specialized in connecting systems and data for better patient outcomes.  

#### 2023 was a big year for healthcare verticalization

2023 was a big year for the tech world (generative AI), but it was also a big year for healthcare consolidation.  A few months ago, the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/08/who-profits-most-from-americas-baffling-health-care-system) provided some interesting analysis into the recent cost drivers of the US healthcare system, focusing on 3rd party brokers (i.e., insurance) vs. pharmaceutical companies and health systems.  

Most of this activity involved verticalization by health insurance companies.  For example, 

The questions remain: Will costs go up/down?  Will health outcomes improve?  What role does technology play?

#### The role of technology

Over time, I've come to believe to 

> 

#### health outcomes may or may not improve




#### GenAI is a hit, but its value remains to be seen in healthcare 

One thing to note is that LLMs are limited by their tendency to [hallucinate](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination).  It means that a generative AI system can output novel text that sound completely plausible, but are factually incorrect.  Currently, there are more focused LLMs trained on the medical domain that are under development, with the idea that narrower models may mitigate these hallucinations.

Despite these limitations, I agree with the authors that LLMs still have value in healthcare.  My key takeaways:
* ChatGPT may be better suited to situations where common medical conditions are seen and have a standard treatment plan (i.e., primary care) 
* Automating common cases can free up physician time for more complex cases or other tasks
* In complex clinical cases, employing human reasoning and intuition can mean life or death for a patient 

Lastly, I would argue that most physicians aim to establish a trust relationship with their patients, mutually working towards the best possible outcome.  This type of relationship fails to exist between a human and a computer.
