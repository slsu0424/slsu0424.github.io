For 2024, I'm going to be switching up some of my writings to focus a bit more on the healthcare industry and current trends.  2023 was a fun time exploring the newest toy in tech (generative AI), but it also came with its share of optimists and pessimists/realists when talking tech in healthcare.  I thought it warranted deeper inspection beyond the technology itself, which I will attempt to explore from various angles in separate posts.

#### Poor health outcomes still plague the US

The current tech buzz reminds me of the time almost a decade ago when IBM Watson Health aimed to [transform healthcare](https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/10/ibm-watson-health-sale-lessons/), to much fanfare and eventual sell-off.

For such a vision, have we actually made progress since that time?

By "transform healthcare", I define this as improved health outcomes, longer life expectancy, and lowered costs.  According to the [Peterson Center-KFF Health System Tracker](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/#Life%20expectancy%20and%20per%20capita%20healthcare%20spending%20(PPP%20adjusted),%202022), in 2022, the US life expectancy at birth still lagged behind its peer countries:

Now let's look at health expenditures: In 2022, the US spent over $4,000 more per person on healthcare than the next highest spending country (Germany), and almost twice as much as the average of comparable countries.  Note that the US life expectancy still ranks the lowest in the list:

If we look more deeply into *whom* is consuming the majority of US healthcare services, a 2021 report showed that greater than 50% of the overall healthcare spend is attributed to people 55 and up:

![PC-KFF2](/assets/images/2024-01/share-of-total-population-and-total-health-spending-by-age-group-2021.png)

When we look at these stats compared to other countries, I found it striking that despite all the technological advances that our economy produces - [the US is #1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-produce-best-software-222422955.html) when it comes to producing software engineers - US health outcomes still fare worse than our neighbors.

The above data suggests a bleak answer to my question: The US is regressing in attempting to transform healthcare.

So what gives?

I am not a health economist, but I am reorienting myself to understand the economics and policies that shape today's healthcare system.  I am increasingly aware of the shortfalls encountered in fixing healthcare, and have tempered my expectations of what technology can/cannot do.  This comes from my own experiences as a patient, conversations with health providers, and as a technologist specialized in systems and data.

#### 2023 was a big year for "big health"

2023 was a big year for the tech world (generative AI), but it was also a big year for healthcare consolidation.  A few months ago, the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/08/who-profits-most-from-americas-baffling-health-care-system) provided some interesting analysis into the recent cost drivers of the US healthcare system, focusing on 3rd party brokers or "big health" (i.e., insurance, drug distributors, PBMs) vs. pharmaceutical companies and health systems.

Most of this activity involved verticalization by such companies.  For example, over the last decade, there has been progressive M&A activity by big names such as CVS Health, Cigna, and UnitedHealth.  These transactions have amounted to over $300B across more than 130 deals:

Perhaps most striking was that these 3rd party players were not just buying up their competitors - CVS buying Aetna (insurer/insurer), Cigna buying Express Scripts (insurer/PBM) - they were also going buying up healthcare providers.  In February 2023, Optum quietly [purchased](https://rockinst.org/blog/a-mid-year-update-on-2023-healthcare-trends/) Crystal Run Healthcare, a 400-person physician group in New York.  In April 2023, California-based Kaiser [acquired](https://medcitynews.com/2023/04/kaiser-permanente-acquire-geisinger-hospital-merger/) Geisinger, a Pennslyvania-based health system.  While financial terms of these deals were not disclosed, Amazon's completion of its $3.9B [acquisition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2023/02/22/amazon-achieves-closing-of-one-medical-deal-officially-entering-doctor-clinic-business/?sh=28ba5b7f747b) of One Medical in February 2023 gives some insight into the magnitude and importance for these buyers.

This surely has to be a good thing for all healthcare stakeholders, right?

Industry executives think so, with the idea that verticalization will bring all important aspects of medical care - physicians, pharmacy, insurance, and IT systems - under one roof.  I certainly like that idea, as the current setup of running around between these entities is beyond frustrating for everyone involved.  This is supported by the Commonwealth Fund's [report](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/oct/high-us-health-care-spending-where-is-it-all-going), where administrative costs account for 30% of excess US healthcare spend: 

![Commonwealth](/assets/images/2024-01/high_us_health_care_spending_where_is_it_all_going_exhibit.png)

But will this hurt patients in the end?  The Economist suggests that there could be unfair competition due to consolidation.  Quality of patient care may suffer.  All the while, these healthcare intermediaries have been producing excess returns greater than the S&P 500.  Much of this has not come to fruition yet, so it will be interesting to see if this strategy pays off.  

#### The role of technology

With such consolidation, I am a proponent that the right combination of market forces and emerging technologies can create more efficiencies.  One of the earliest benefits I see for generative AI is the ability to summarize data quickly.  This can alleviate the administrative burden, especially for pulling together clinical narratives and structured patient data in EHRs, as well as handling workflows such as pre-authorizations.  In fact, these were the [top generative AI use cases](https://www.bain.com/insights/getting-the-most-out-of-generative-ai-in-healthcare/) per a Bain & Company report:

But this is just one very small piece.  I agree with Dr. Robert Pearl's (former CEO of The Permanente Medical Group) [assessment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertpearl/2023/05/31/what-kaisers-acquisition-of-geisinger-means-for-us-all/?sh=63d95c665796) that the key to Kaiser Permanente's decades of success was due to a combination of innovative insurers and physicians.  I would put next-gen technologies in the innovation box, but it will fail on its own.

However, I suspect that not every healthcare entity is or will ever become part of a "big health" entity.  The question still remains as to whether these non-big health entities can still serve the majority of patients that consume the most health care services (55+).
