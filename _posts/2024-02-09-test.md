Continuing on from my previous post on emerging tech's value in healthcare, I was intrigued to review EHR adoption across other countries.  As I wrote about in a previous [post](https://slsu0424.github.io/switchover-disruptions-true-cost-ai-scribe), EHRs are still a painpoint for many of its users, despite the fact that [96% of hospitals](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/96-of-us-hospitals-have-ehrs-but-barriers-remain-to-interoperability-onc-says.html) have them.  Of course, I am as excited as everyone else at generative AI's potential to reduce this administrative workload for clinical staff.  But is this emerging tech significant enough to make a meaningful impact?

## EHR use in the US vs. abroad: Poor technology not to blame

Its been a number of years since I studied EHRs in an academic setting, but A 2020 JAMA [report](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774129) set out to compare clinician usage of EHRs in the United States and in other countries.  The report studied EHR metadata of 371 health systems in the US and abroad.  I will focus on the paper's key findings and discussion, and its implications from a technology perspective.

Key findings on US clinicians:
1. Spent more time per day using the EHR
2. Received more system-generated messages
3. Wrote a higher proportion of automatically generated notes
4. Spent more time using the EHR after hours

Discussion:
1. Recent [research](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/) has shown that US-based health care organizations are not better than their neighboring countries in most process quality measures during care delivery.  Its unlikely that information technology could help improve these measures significantly.
2. The US [Meaningful Use](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/meaningful-use-electronic-health-record-ehr-incentive) incentive program mandated both secure messaging with patients and electronic prescribing.  This has meant additional time spent by US clinicians on handling messages.
3. EHR functions, such as e-prescribing, may improve safety and save time in the care delivery process.  This was less likely to be observed among non-US clinicians, who may write prescriptions manually.
4. US clinicians used EHRs in different ways that are driven by unique workflows or policy.  Factors such as a multipayer billing environment and Meaningful Use requirements may contribute to clinicians overdocumenting to ensure reimbursable claims or to prevent malpractice lawsuits.  

## Considerations for the technologist

Its important to be wary of solutions looking for a problem.  In my experience, the next big tech idea in healthcare does not always fix problems.  Oftentimes, it introduces new ones.  There has to be a clear and compelling problem that technology can actually solve, and one with a demonstratable ROI.  

As the report above illustrates, the administrative burden of EHRs is an area ripe for disruption.  The text summarization capabilites of LLMs make them a compelling solution for today's EHR woes.  Does it have a fit in a clinician's workflow?  I think so, but its also important to temper expectations of how much change the technology can achieve.  There are significant government interventions and existing workflows that may limit the technology's potential. 

## Conclusion
This paper was insightful to understand the differences in EHR adoption in the US and abroad.  I was always very curious to understand why 
This short analysis helped me better understand the external forces driving the ever-increasing costs of healthcare in the United States.  Despite the technological prowess of the US, our country still falls behind in terms of health outcomes and spend.  I suspect that if we continue to see more consolidations, these tech innovations could play a more important role in health outcomes.
